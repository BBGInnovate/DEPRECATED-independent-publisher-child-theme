Independent Publisher Child Theme
===========================

This child theme can be used to override styles and features of the [Independent Publisher](http://independentpublisher.me) theme.

## Installation

This [Child Theme](http://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes) requires the parent Independent Publisher theme, so be sure that you have that installed first. Then, simply download this child theme and place it your `wp-content/themes/` folder and then activate it from **Appearance â†’ Themes**. 

Once activated, you can start making changes to the child theme's `style.css` file and/or `functions.php`. The changes you make in those files will simply override the parent theme's styles and functions.

See the comments in `style.css` and `functions.php` for examples.
